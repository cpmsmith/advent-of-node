# Advent of Code 2020

## Running
On days whose input is more than a few characters, the programs take input from `stdin`. `download.sh` automatically downloads a given day's input to `day-$N/input.txt`, for convenience.

## Setup
For the download script, you need to grab your session cookie from your browser, and put it in a `.env` file in the root directory, like so:

```sh
COOKIE="session=9f6736f426ce421e127fdd59d4a7ad6563ceec469f6736f426ce421e127fdd59d4a7ad6563ceec469f6736f426ce421e"
```
